TEAM AWSOME


**Test file for everyone to get comfortable with git. 

For this weekend:

-play with git, and become comfortable with the interface
-work with sessions in php
-check out the Moodle API docs

This is what Kris wants to do:
-Play with git, get comfortable with Fetch/Commit/Merge/Push
-Look up PHP session variable functionality
-Do some reading on the Moodle API
-A little work on data structure dependencies
-Go to the Bruins game with the bestest girlfriend!


Also, I'll be creating that Google chat so we don't have to use this for communication. 
I'm hoping to have the git interface figured out, as well as have everything we need for communication / file transfering up and running by the end of the weekend.
